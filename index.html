      <p>Hello! I'm 28 and have been living in Austin for the past 10 years. I have 2 beautiful kitties who are my world. In my free time, I love to bake, bike, collect cool rocks, and scrapbook.</p>
      <p>My current profession is in public health and nutrition education, but I'm looking to make a hard change on my career path. I believe technology is only going to become more useful and relevant as time goes on, and I want to constantly learn and keep up.</p>
      <p>I'm looking forward to taking on some new skills and meeting new people who are wanting to learn like me </p>
